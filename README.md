# **Web-based Chat application demo**

In order to get more familiar with the dark (front) side, I decided to
implement a simple chat-type application. Most of the general ideas were borrowed from this [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified). However, being a curious being, I tried to toggle and refactor some of the components.

I am planning to implement the backend with `Golang`, which I am currently very interested in.

**TODO:**

+ Chat components
+ Frontend styling and design
+ Docs
+ Backend core and endpoints
+ DB integration
